### Summary

Philips hue automations have one large disadvantage - if the light isn't reachable when the automation is supposed to run, it never does.
This app checks every time a light is reachable again, if it corresponds to a scene and sets this scene.

### Installation

Right now the only way to install this app is to clone this repository and build it on the platform of your choice.
Pre-builds are [planned](https://github.com/simonwep/hue-scheduler/issues/6), as well as [docker images](https://github.com/simonwep/hue-scheduler/issues/5).

### Usage

Coming soon...
